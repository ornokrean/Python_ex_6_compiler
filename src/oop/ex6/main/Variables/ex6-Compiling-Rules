VARIABLES :

---legal stuff:

-Its possible to support, or not to, in naming a variable in a protected word in java, such as: int while = 5;

-Method parameters are local variables of the method!

-In case of several variables with the same name a reference to a variable will reference the one in the most specific scope.


-Only two kinds of variables; global and local.
legal definition of a variable is:

                            type name = value;


-It is also legal to define a variable without declaring its value meaning:

                            type name; (example: int a; )



-It is also legal to define several variables in the same line:

                            double a,b;

                            char c = 'Z',f;

                            boolean a,b,c,d = true , f = 20;



-Name:= any sequence matching the rule: ([a-zA-Z]+|[_]+[a-zA-Z]+)[a-zA-Z_0-9]*
(meaning: first letter can be the character "_" but it must be followed with a letter. all number and letters
allowed)


---illegal stuff:


-It is illegal to  declare a variable in 2 lines:

int a
= 5;    (an illegal statement).


-There cannot be two global variables with the same name. though a local variable can have the same name as a
global variable.

-Two local variables cannot be initiated with the same name.

-Illegal java modifiers: public/private/static.

-Important : a ! local !  variable cannot be used unless its been assigned before, meaning if a variable was
not initialised in its declaration, either it will not be used at all later, or the next time it is called is
its assignment of value.

-A global variable can be referenced before the line it was assigned of declared.

-A global variable can only be assigned with another global variable only if it was already assigned.

-In case of an variable that has not assigned a value, any method that calls him must assign a value to it
first inside the method. (here the request is trying to avoid the case of not assigning a value to a var and
using it un-assigned since we do not know which method will be called before).


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

METHODS

---legal stuff :

- Name := as defined for a variable.  but cannot start with [0-9] or "_".

- Parameters := A list seperated by commas of : valid type and a valid variable name (that has no value!)

- Only void methods are supported.

- Methods can call other methods in the file, regardless of their location.

- Return statement can appear anywhere but must appear in the last line of the code like such:   return;

- A method signature can contain the word "final" upon one of the parameters - it just mean its illegal for the method to change the value of the parameter.

- A method must end with a '}'

- A method can call itself (recursion is allowed).


---illegal stuff :

- Calling a method with incompatible variables, wrong number of variables, or uninitialised variables.

- Its illegal to do method overloading, meaning creating 2 functions with the same name but different number of parameters.

- illegal to declare a method inside a method

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IF/WHILE :

---legal stuff:

- The first line must end with a '{'
 and the last line of the block must end with a '}' and nothing else, like in the a method block.

- The condition inside the if must be boolean, as described above.

- IF/WHILE blocks are regular block of code and can contain variable declaration and method calls etc.

- IF/WHILE blocks can be nested as much as needed.

- The '||' and '&&' statements can appear.

---illegal stuff :

- The '||' and '&&' statements must be separated by value of a kind meaning this is illegal : if(||a){ , if(a || && b).

- The "if else","do/while","for","switch", are not required to be supported.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL STUFF :

---legal stuff:

-Necessary whitespaces :
    - A methods name to the "void" - return type.
    - A variable name to its type.
    - A final modifier and variable type: finalString a = "a" - is illegal.

- A legal line in s-java :

- An empty line, \s should catch is, and should be ignored.

- A comment line which starts with  "//", nothing before the "//", nor white spaces, anything can appear after the //.

- A code line the must end with a ";" or "{" or "}".  whitespaces may appear before or after the suffixes. the suffix cannot be
  moved to the next line instead.


---illegal stuff:


- Packages are not supported, not exceptions (includes try,catch,finally).

- Each line of code must appear in a single line, also not two statements in one line.

- Classes, interfaces, enums.

- Javadoc and multiline comments "/**..*/"

- Single line comments in the code, meaning after a code line writing ,  // something...

- Operators (int a 3 - 5; , String b = "00" + "P")

- Arrays are not supported.

- String value := does not contain  \ or ' or " or ,

- White spaces are usually ignored and can be anywhere, except inside reserved words and variable declarations
  this is illegal : "i n t a =5;", "i f(a||b){"
  and in illegal in the start of a comment meaning this is illegal : " \\comment"


  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  int :=  can only get whole numbers.

  double :=  can get a int or a double  (example :  2.58)

  String := any number of characters between two  ""  (example : "sT98*^$&")

  boolean := true,false or any number, int or double.

  char := any character in a quotation mark (example : '&','1'...)
